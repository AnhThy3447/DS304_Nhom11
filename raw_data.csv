584,160,we were a group of 8  we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us ,,,,,
585,160,to start with  the place does not have well groomed and professional staff  they hardly understand what you speak ,,,,Negative,
586,160,the first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10  we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us ,,,,,
587,160,as soon as we got seated  a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people  we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly  but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming  it was not even 6 pm then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us ,,,,,
588,160,we told him that incase more crowd comes we will move ,,,,,
589,160,secondly  we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses  when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don t have any ,,,,Negative,
590,160,we had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly ,,,,Negative,
591,160,the service was slow  we had to keep looking for waiters ,,,,Negative,
592,160,we were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 pm  but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6 50 pm saying by they serve it would cross 7 pm ,,,,Negative,
593,160,doesn t that sound ridiculous ,,,,,
594,160,again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones  when the argument was not stopping i suggested my friends that we should go to 10d  to which the waiter present said we should go to 10d they use glass tumblers  after he said that we demanded meeting the manager ,,,,Negative,
595,160,the manager came and he was a nightmare  he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us  when we said we will give bad rating  review the manager said  ok sir  we are also dangerous people  we were shocked at this ,,,,Negative,
596,160,our evening was spoilt already  so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere ,,,,,

1315,335,i dont understand why do these restaurants provide their mobile number  if they dont have intention to respond to customers ,,,,,
1316,335,in case of cancelling the order why should the restaurant accept the order first and y should they regret to decline the order that too after 45 mins ,,,,,
1317,336,avoid this place for your lifetime if you want to stay healthy     ,,,,,
1318,336,we have ordered mutton biryani and it had dead flies in it   we thought it fell into the biryani bowl while adding rice into it   but when my husband thoroughly checked the whole biryani we could easily see 3 within 3 minutes ,,Negative,,,

1328,339,will never ever order from this place again nor will my friends order from here again ,,,,,Negative
1329,340,well sometimes rating can be misleading ,,,,,
1330,340,we visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine ,,,,,
1331,340,the beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of corona bucket ,,,,,
1332,340,bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled ,,,,Negative,
1333,340,well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp ,,,,,
1334,340,we were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp ,,Negative,,,
1335,340,and the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer ,,,,Negative,
1336,340,we asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had dragon chicken served ,,,,,
1337,340,eating it all i can say if it s ur best then your worst is not for humans ,,Negative,,,
1338,340,next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud ,,Negative,,,
1339,340,all i can say if you know what a good food  ambiance and hang out place never ever visit this place ,,,,,
1340,341,very slow service  food was very cold and tasteless ,,Negative,,Negative,
1341,341,tables were not cleaned properly ,,,,Negative,
1342,341,not worth going again ,,,,,Negative
1343,341,although ice tea was decent enough ,,,,,
1344,342,chicken inside the shawarma got spoiled and smelling too   once opened it and was smelling spoiled   before ordering only i thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time   ,,Negative,,,
1345,342,but due to the trust on shah ghouse ordered it   and initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it  ,,Negative,,,
1346,342,i last order i thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday i ordered shawarma and he repeated the same   food quality in shah ghouse getting bad day by day,,Negative,,,
1347,343,i received my life times worst ever noodles from here    got a smell and taste like it is burnt over coal   though it has been two days since i tasted   my buds still remember the taste ,,Negative,,,
1348,343,hate that and no response from zomato for the complaint even now ,,,,Negative,
1349,343,i don t prefer to order or have something from this place again ,,,,,Negative
1350,344,this place is nothing as it is shown in the images ,,,,,
1351,344,the ambience maybe good  but the service is too bad ,,,Positive,Negative,
1352,344,the chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as i thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp ,,,,,
1353,344,and if this was not enough the add on was the main course ,,,,,
1354,344,the name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food  which creates a lot of confusion ,,,,,
1355,344,we ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies  rather than semi gravy ,,,,,
1356,344,the worst is the suggestions from the manager  who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered ,,,,Negative,
1357,344,knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy  it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them ,,,,,
1358,344,moreover despite of showing the zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food  they added an extra service charge to the final bill ,,,,Negative,
1359,344,won t complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing ,,,,,
1360,344,my suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking  and importantly don t try and take suggestion from the management ,,,,,

1418,358,like really ,,,,,
1419,358,speaking on everyone s behalf  it could be a budget constraint or someone s personal preference of beer  but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and i m really disappointed this time ,,,,,

1436,362, writing this review as soon as i got out of the restaurant  from the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience ,,,,,
1437,362,left right after starters ,,,,,
1438,362,i wouldn t even care to rate it one star ,,,,,
1439,362,one of worst restaurants to dine in ,,,,,
1440,362,i think it ll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more the    after reaching at 2 pm there was no receptionist ,,,,,
1441,362,after the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people ,,,,,
1442,362,it was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged ,,,,Negative,
1443,362,that s it ,,,,,

1446,362,it was hot ,,,,,
1447,362,thanks pot pourri for understanding and making our dining uncomfortable  ,,,,,
1448,362,after we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we re opting for veg or non veg ,,,,,
1449,362,by this time i was already wondering if they thought we re idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want  i just realised that it was true ,,,,Negative,
1450,362,after soup and buttermilk starters were served painfully slow ,,,,Negative,
1451,362,it took more than an hour for them to finish serving just 6 starters ,,,,,
1452,362,were they kidding me  ,,,,,
1453,362,they wasted my precious time and this isn t what a customer wants ,,,,Negative,
1454,362,if you can t give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere ,,,,,
1455,362,we had to school the waiters regarding their service  then we spoke to their leader i guess  and he also gave the same old typical answer  sorry ,,,,Negative,
1456,362,i ll just get that served for you  ,,,,,
1457,362,we don t want no sorry ,,,,,
1458,362,you can t placate us with sorry for our time  hard work and money spent ,,,,,
1459,362,after seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to  sorrys  ,,,,,
1460,362,i decided to leave the restaurant ,,,,,
1461,362,after all this he had the audacity to charge us the complete bill ,,,,,
1462,362,it was 1100 ,,,,,
1463,362,it wasn t even worth it even if we had the whole menu ,,,,,
1464,362,after arguing he decided to give 10  discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we had  ,,,,,
1465,362,wouldn t suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant ,,,,,
1466,362,starters  i found the starters to be normal good in quality ,,Positive,,,

2676,1416,first i will talk about the quantity it was upto thw mark as per the price of the food abd now coming to the taste  ,Negative,Negative,,,
2677,1416,fried rice was disgusting because it was like made from rice of last night and it was not good to eat ,,Negative,,,
2678,1416,coming to manchurian i will say it was a average manchurian and not that good ,,Negative,,,
2679,1417,this outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd ,,,,,
2680,1417,the ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space ,,,Positive,,
2681,1417,it was well lit but could really deck up a few notches ,,,Positive,,
2682,1417,it was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant ,,,Negative,,
2683,1417,upon arrival  were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation ,,Positive,,Positive,
2684,1417,we were asked if we are here for buffet ,,,,,

2686,1417,i had a look at the menu and it didn t interest me ,,,,,
2687,1417,the manager at this place was a nice fellow ,,,,Positive,
2688,1417,who carefully took our order of dragon chicken  punjabi chicken curry  and garlic naan ,,,,Positive,
2689,1417,after a fair bit of waiting time  we re served with dragon chicken ,,,,,
2690,1417,i would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry  so that the flavours stick to the chicken ,,Negative,,,
2691,1417,it was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation ,,,,Negative,
2692,1417,the servers need to be taught a little bit about serving ,,,,Negative,
2693,1417,they were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers ,,,,Negative,

2697,1417,most restaurants in this part of india assume that all dishes of punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief ,,Negative,,,

2705,1417,i am not a fan of multi cuisine ,,,,,
2706,1417,when you have such a title  you should at least try to make it work for you ,,,,,
2707,1417,the restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant north indian population or the traditional south indian population ,,,,,Negative
2708,1417,one thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their buffet menu ,,,,,Negative
2709,1417,they tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion ,,,,,Negative
2710,1417,had the restaurant  been a traditional southern one  i would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content ,,,,,Negative
2711,1417,the restaurant needs to find its footing ,,,,,Negative
2712,1417,the owners need to decide which way they want to go ,,,,,Negative

3681,2482,we ordered soba noodles with pork and veggies  naga pork curry  which came with rice  and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots ,,,,,
3682,2482,the noodles were alright  but had sort of a maggi consistency   but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor ,,Neutral,,,
3683,2482,the naga pork curry was a revelation   spicy but so full of flavor  my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit ,,Positive,,,
3684,2482,the fried pork was delicious too  but an overkill  going by how we were already full with the first two dishes ,,Positive,,,
3685,2482,we had ordered the flavored beer they have  which was refreshing but relatively overpriced ,Negative,Positive,,,
3686,2482,but just for the food  i think we need to visit again ,,Positive,,,
