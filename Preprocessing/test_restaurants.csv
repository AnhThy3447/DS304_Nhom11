1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Gep Yalong,5,"Everything was amazing. Food and variety with customizability, ambiance with music, the service, and even the comfort room was excellent.

We got the Beef Biryani and Lamb Masala with plain naan. Serving was generous, enough for 3. No gamey or domesticated taste! Was also easy to chew / eat. Really delicious and filling, rich taste.

Also had Mango Lassi. It was really heavy and delicious!

Service was good and fast. Comfort room was clean and complete with supplies (no bidet).

I would recommend this place to everyone."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Mario Garcia-Gillespie,5,Fantastic local restaurant with a great dinner for 2 deal that will definitely leave food for lunch the next day. Food was cook to perfection and the curry and spices were spot on.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Sukanya Arunkumar,5,We had come on a visit to LA. We had ordered takeouts of veg biryani and samosa on the first day of our visit. They were delicious! They told us that they even deliver. So next time we ordered butter naan and dhal tadka over the phone and they delivered within 30-40 minutes to the hotel we stayed in. It was so tasty! This restaurant is way too underrated. I don't understand why Anar Indian Restaurant never showed up when we were searching for Indian restaurants on the internet nearby the hotel we stayed. We are so glad we found it by accident while we walked across to get some stuff from CVS. Highly recommend this place!
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Katherine,5,"This is my favorite Indian spot in LA, and the quality of the food keeps me coming back. Every dish I‚Äôve tried has been deeply flavorful, balanced, and clearly made with fresh ingredients. The lunch specials are a perfect way to sample a variety, served with aromatic white rice and soft, warm naan. The masala is rich with layered spice, the sag is consistently earthy and comforting, and the korma has a silky, complex flavor that stands out. The paratha is flaky and satisfying, and the naan is always pillowy and charred just right. I‚Äôm working my way through the menu and haven‚Äôt hit a single miss."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Priyanka Bengaluru,4,"Service was amazing. Tried their one person dinner - it was amazing. Dal soup could have been better, chicken tandoor was yum, naan and chicken vindaloo was yum, samosa was good too. Quantity was perfect. Would return back to try other items on their menu."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Mindee Jorgensen,5,"I would always get this for delivery and it has been consistently fresh and delicious. Recommend Sag Paneer (I think the best I have had in LA.) I have had both chicken and veggie Masala and both were great.  One time when we ordered online we forgot to add rice and they threw one in complimentary which was so kind of them. The side sauces are great too.  I have yet to visit in person,  but was just looking them up just now, deciding where to go for my birthday dinner. I can imagine it will be wonderful fresh out of the kitchen."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,ellie hutchison,1,Ordered food for delivery and never received my food - it was supposed to take 45-mins and I waiting two hours. I tried to call the restaurant 6 times over a span of 45-minutes and it would just ring then go to a beep and then hangup.  How do you resolve something if you can't speak to anyone?
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Jessica Levin,5,"I decided to try a new restaurant and so ordered buttered chicken, sag paneer, veggie samosas (not pictured), and white rice from here. I had prepared a cup of milk, anticipating that the food would be spicy. Surprisingly, nothing was spicy except for the provided sauces! The food was delicious and I unfortunately couldn't finish everything at once, even though I really wanted to. I highly recommend this place! :-)"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Shakira Powers,5,"The food here is absolutely amazing! Being raised in London with Indian heritage, I know good Indian cuisine when I taste it, and this place is a true hidden gem. After living in California for over seven years and trying Indian food in many spots, this is hands down my favorite. The flavors are rich, authentic, and consistently delicious. Thank you, Anar restaurant, for making such incredible Indian food with such apparent ease - it‚Äôs no small feat! God bless you for sharing your gift with us"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Parthasarathi Dash,5,Tandoori Chicken and chicken wings were good. We also ordered spinach lentil curry which was also good.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Fahad Hossain,5,"Ordered here after a long time, got the Buy1 Get1 deal Dal Tadka & Garlic Basil Naan and they were absolutely delicious! If you like vegetarian options then you gotta try their Dal Tadka (Order it Hot if you‚Äôre into spicy üå∂Ô∏è dishes)"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Samantha Quinn,5,"It was a great, chill spot were items were made fresh! Now the is a 5 star low cost meal. The shrimp came out sizzling and the Naan was fresh and hot. Everyone was so gracious  and kind. Loved the saag paneer with a good spice. The masala was on the sweeter side."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Galya Alfreihi,2,"- ""B"" rating posted on window from the inspection, extremely discouraging, saw it in the middle of the meal:/
- Chicken wasn't fresh in the chicken masala dish
- Has to change a table because the first one smelled funny

I came here long time ago and had a memory of it being a tasty hole in the wall place. My recent visit turned out to be nothing like the memory. Wouldn't come again"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Michael Chen,5,"Hands down the best tikka masala I‚Äôve ever had. I drive out of my way to get it here. This place deserves much higher reviews than it gets. The butter naan is incredible too.

The owner and employees are very kind."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Re lentless,1,I never ate such a bad dish. I ordered two butter chicken combos and it tastes like somebody put 1 kilgogram of sugar in it. Im not a picky eater but I couldn finish this dish. Disgusting. The Cheese Naan was also the worst I had ever tasted. Never again.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Danice Cabanela,5,"I‚Äôm surprised that this place doesn‚Äôt have more stars bc they never disappoint! We lived in the area for 7 years, and frequented this place often. We always felt like the food was great, service was good and price point very reasonable compared to other restaurants whose fare wasn‚Äôt as delicious and also came at a higher cost. (I hope they stay that way!). Anar also values people in the neighborhood, and always treated us well. We ate there the night we first moved into Hollywood, and then also the week we moved out, and countless times in between.  Highly recommend the vegetarian dinner for 2: great deal and so yummy. Anar will always remain one of our LA faves no matter where we move‚Ä¶ ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Mindee Jorgensen,5,"This has been a go to place of ours for years, and we just ordered delivery tonight.  I wanted to give a review because we were talking about how consistent and quality Anar is. We have gotten delivery multiple times over the past few years. They have never messed up our order (but that one time I forgot to add rice to my order, they included a complimentary rice.)  The food is always delivered hot, the flavor is consistent and the ingredients are always good quality. The spicy levels are accurate, hot has a nice kick, medium still has a mellow kick with great flavor. (Never tried mild...)
We have only visited the restaurant once a couple years back. I remember it was clean and comfortable.
Of course we will be ordering again. :)"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Jennie Kelley,5,"I thought the food was awesome! We went on a Monday around lunch time and it wasn't busy at all. We got our food quickly. They make it easy for vegetarians/vegans and label what I'd vegan or vegetarian. I got the okra dish. So amazing, never had okra before and the dish was perfectly spiced. Like most Indian restaurants, the food is served family style (in a large dish and you serve it onto you plate). I just wish I had a great Indian restaurant like this is San Diego!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Kanwer Manan,4,"We just planned to go to this restaurant and never had an expectation to get great food.

The moment we entered and got greetings was so great...we ordered the food again the expectation was nothing but once we started having food... Amazing, super and great are the right words to explain the food... We ate like anything and said thanks to the owner/manager for keeping the super taste without burning the belly. Keep it up üëç. If you are reading this comment - you must try the food here once for sure. You will love it."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Tazzzie333,4,Costumer service was excellent. Waiter was very nice and attentive. Food was very good. I ordered butter chicken and tandoori chicken. I really enjoyed the butter chicken but the tandoori chicken was missing color. It wasn't red like it usually is and the dish had no tomatoes. That's why I gave it a four stars. The restaurant is small and cozy but food overall is pretty good. Prices are very good. There's parking as well. I will definitely come back.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Ev G-S,4,"The food was very good. The server stated the level of flavors/spice could be adjusted. We had a rather large party and we ordered a wide variety of foods. Some in the party were not familiar with Indian food and everyone enjoyed everything. Wait staff was very busy, seemed like there were many delivery orders and we noticed many orders picked up. I recommend it and would eat here again."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,King LAtto,1,Ordered off Uber eats.. the Tandoori chicken was on special bogo. When it arrived both platters where under cooked bloody chicken ü§Æü§Æ I instantly threw it in the trash and had to reorder dinner from another place. Idk if they is a usual thing for them for off day but definitely won‚Äôt be eating here again! ‚Ä¶
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Jennie Sherer,5,"This is one of my favorite Indian spots in LA! The vegetarian dinner for two is my go to, the malai kofta is my absolute favorite. Everything is so fresh and delicious, service is friendly, and everything I‚Äôve ever had makes me so happy."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Tania G,5,"Delicious food! Pescatarian and vegetarian friendly place with well-organized menu (no surprise meat). Good lamb dishes, too. My favorite Indian delivery place in Hollywood. The food always arrives well-packed and the right temperature. They have their own drivers, so delivery is quick."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Tristine Moore (Karma),1,"I am sooooo pissed & very disappointed. I used to think their Indian food was the bomb until today. I used to live across street from this place a few yrs back & would make an occasional visit even after I moved. But today's visit gave a totally different vibe from the moment I walked in. No customers, I the decor was basic & no longer gives that cultural vibe. Then there was menu discrepancies"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Animesh Panda,3,"There is ample parking in front, it is just a little walk away from walk of fame. The food is rather basic but good if you want a quick meal, such as their chicken plate. The ambience is basic as well."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Raisa Bhattacharji,1,Just ordered tandoori chicken and received burnt tandoori. Waste of money and time.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Marissa Forrester,3,"Great tasting food. Shrimp curry is lovely ( if you enjoy sweet food). And Chicken Masala was delicious. Speedy home delivery, I was surprised. For the price take-away food portions are very small. Increase food portions for take-away to get higher rating!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Catherine,4,Just fantastic flavors & the samosas were the best I've ever eaten. Coconut shrimp slightly overdone - the one and only bit of meh. Service was lovely & I received a free dessert for no apparent good reason ‚ò∫ Highly recommended.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,M G,5,"I was there last month visiting California from New Jersey (finally have time to review)

I have to say. This place food is absolutely amazing!
I have never tasted such amazing Indian food ever.

The spice level is absolutely perfect. The food is well cooked. We even ordered food to go for our folks that we went to go visit. The chicken biryani was my favorite! The appetizer sample is great as well!

The service is very nice!

I highly recommend this spot!
Byob! Next door there is a liquor store, bring your own liquor!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,basamaro1,4,"The curry beef was medium spicy, the cuts were well cooked, the curry was made so you can eat it with something sweet and less salt than what many are used to, if your salty bring a shaker, the rice was 7, and the flat bread was 8. Presentation: the curry portion was a little big, the plate was polished steel my fav. the bread might be better cut into semi circular pieces.  The place needs a little remodel but I like the unkept furniture."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,E F,4,"Seriously so good!! The Naans are amazing and veggie masala is delicious. I ordered my food late and it came steaming hot. 10 minutes later my food was still piping hot- rare for delivery! Only thing is main dish does not come with rice. Great food, great service, all around great restaurant. I'll definitely return!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Frannie Morrison,5,"Okay..I LOVE this place. Not only is it super close to where I am, but more importantly the food is ALWAYS delicious and filling.
The staff is incredibly gracious and attentive. I usually order to go, and sometimes while I've waited for my food, they've brought out complimentary small dishes- soup, rice pudding- and always with a glass of water.
I will continue going here again and again!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Brian Hockenmaier,5,"This place is awesome.  You get a lot of food for what you pay, and the Korma is one of the best Indian dishes I've ever had.

One word of warning:  last I checked, the dinner combo with the soup costs more than all of its components individually.  So it's best to buy individual dishes, rice, naan, etc when you order here."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,see ka,1,We ordered chicken biryani and it Is not like biryani at all and very bad taste. Samosa and paneer tikka was horrible and we had stomach upset. Our evening got spoiled during our trip in LA. I didn't expect that the food would give stomach upset.my kids ate the food too.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Carmen Settman,5,"I love the authenticity of this place; it‚Äôs not fussy, the heat is not on when the temperature drops but it has everything that I expect from northern Indian cuisine. Super friendly service and really good food. The malai kofta is on point, along with onion kulcha and samosas. I was even gifted to try their ginger mint lemonade and a soup because I expressed interest after he rang me up. If you want ambience, this is not your place. But if you crave good Indian food after work one day, where you can be in and out, maybe with a friend, and be taken care of really well; this is your spot. Great for take away!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Paul Vakselis,5,My absolute favorite Indian Food in the LA area. I was thankful that when i moved from Los Feliz to NoHo that I was still in their delivery area!!!  We always get the Veg Dinner for 2 and it's always mountain of well prepared and tasty food for a pretty reasonable price.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Gerald Griffin,1,Prices are outrageous a sagg paner rice and garlic naan 21$ yeah right‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just a plain rip off the sagg used to come with rice but now it‚Äôs an extra 4 dollars for a small portion of rice this place will never see another dime from me. I‚Äôm suprised it‚Äôs not out of business yet the sagg used to be 8.99 there. Nobody is going to pay 21 dollars for a small cup of sagg and rice.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,gerry furth,4,"This is clearly a family-operated place devoted to good food and service - they are open late hours for the Hollywood neighborhood who loved them and this adds to the friendly, cozy vibe. Customers love their blended tea and lemonade drinks so they bottle them now.  All the Indian classics are on the menu at an affordable price."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Ruby Poythress,4,"The chicken biryani was good. The service was not that good but it got pretty busy and they only had one guy. The waiter let a couple next to me being ans consume alcohol from next door. Overall, it was good. I will order takeout nextime though ."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Shrivatsan Rajagopalan,5,"Very good quality Roti. Bombay aloo was fresh. When asked for Lemon hey gave it right away.

Their Nimbu paani is made at the restaurant and tastes pretty good.

The medium spice level in this restaurant is VERY LOW spice level for INDIAN origin people.

The POS accepts NFC payments.

I liked the fact that printing the Receipt is optional. Hence I liked the fact it was CEO friendly.

The host Clearly knew every single dish and didn‚Äôt even use Pen & Paper. I liked the simple unassuming yet authentic taste of this restaurant.

Don‚Äôt get carried away by the sub-urban shopping lot the restaurant is local at,  the taste compensates for the other short comings."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Priya Ghate,3,"The food is ok but nothing Indian, we ordered Veg Biryani and it had Zucchini in it in yellow Rice. Not authentic Indian food"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Tejas Pal,2,"Both stars for service, provided warm water, freshly made tea, salad upon request. Veg dishes tasted better (dal, okra, naan, roti)
Chicken dishes had a smell. Photos vs real ambiance is very different
The rating must be because of the regular customers"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,mike pasley,3,"They had a suspicious number of 5 star reviews on Grubhub, so I should have known; the hype is bogus, everybody.

The veggie samosas were delicious. The portions were nice. Everything arrived. I ate it all.

But...I ordered HOT as a wild Friday night move. You know, gettin a little spice going. But the spice level must be for infants. My Mom‚Äôs Mom cooks spicier meatloaf than this. Maybe the chef gave up tonight, IDK.

No wow factor guys. Sorry for the bad news."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Nicholas McAndrew,5,"Honestly, just really good, solid Indian food! They are great at the staples, fast, and would definitely get from there again!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Pedram Gol,5,I order delivery from Anar regularly and Anar is my most favorite Indian restaurant so far. I can say they are one of  the best Indian food you can find in LA. Food is always  delicious and prompt . Butter chicken and Beef Tandori are a must try
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Rhiannon ‚ÄúIndigo‚Äù Starlight,4,"Food is great and the portions for the dinner for two were huge! Server was very slow and distracted even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. Lots of people coming in to pick up deliveries... Music was eclectic, like the authentic Indian vibe but could do without the rest."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Beth,5,"Ordered take out: Aloo Gobi and Tarka Dal - just excellent - so good. And the lemonade is perfect for this hot spike of weather! Vegetable samosa with cilantro chutney, Giant garlic naan, and fried rice filled out what is simply a fabulous dinner. Thank you!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Kalzzz,5,Don‚Äôt go by the looks of it. The food was very much delicious.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Suresh chinnam,5,"I have been here for my friend birthday. After searching lot of restaurants I went to this one and that too at closing time. But still management so helpful and they made  my day so easier. Special thanks to Sandhya  front desk who received us and thanks for your patience. Thanks to management. You guys are so sweet. Like your rasmali. The food was so tasty especially the naan and  service also to fast.  And one more thing the prices are so reasonable.

See you guys soon."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Nitin Gaur,1,"Worst food
Worst service

Ordered Dal tadka, bhindi (Okra), and Channa masala.
Only daal was somewhat edible. Bhindi was not fully cooked, I could taste the rawness in vegetable. Channa masala was cooked in the same sauce which is used for butter chicken or butter paneer. Which was not the way you cook channa masala. Despite that, it was pathetic, tasteless and full of color instead of spices.

On top of that the server was very rude. My friend wanted to make sure that tandoori roti they had in their menu was made of whole wheat. The server's behavior was weird instead of telling us straight that yes it is made of whole wheat, he said what else would that be. One of the worst experience in a restaurant ever.

I would say to people of los angeles and whoever visiting, don't go to this restaurant. Don't make the mistake I made by seeing 4 star on yelp. This is not Indian Food. Hell this is not even food. Stay away."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Amit Pagedar,2,"Food was actually great but the waiter was very rude. Was taking our order as if he was doing us a favor and delivery of spoons and plates was brash. The time of visit was the same as the time of this review. The experience of eating was tarnished because of the waiter.

Also he lied that there was no tea when I asked for tea while the menu clearly states there is tea on the menu."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Anil Vurity,1,"Let me start by saying that I can cook better indian food than these guys do . I mean the food here is not even close to indian . The place is not great either . We ordered chicken biryani and chicken curry and trust me when I say that we threw the food away . Yes , we asked the food to be ToGo ( so we could trash it later ) because we could not even eat a single bite if this pathetic food .

DO NOT GO THERE . I regret the money we wasted on this restaurant."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Girish Koli,5,Great Restaurant w/ Yummy Indian Food. Don‚Äôt let the location and size fool you. The food and hospitality is really awesome. Parvez was very humble and welcoming. The food and service was sooo good that we came two days in row.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,ruchi bains,2,It was an Uber eats order so they did not care to send the right bread order. I ordered tandoori roti..it was for my sick kid..and they sent me some fried bread( may be bhatoora)...and my kid couldn‚Äôt eat much. Wouldn‚Äôt order again... the food tasted ok except the bread mess up which was bad for us.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,NIZARALI NATHANI,5,"I have recently visited this restaurant while i was returning from Universal Studio and i was searching on gogle  and i found this  one and main reason i choose this restaurant because of it open at late 1.00 am night and when you travel and visiting Los Angles you always out of time frame and at late at night you find indian food with good quality and excellent service with very sweet spoken girl at night 11.00 clock with sweet smile welcoming guest . Iliked food and specially Sweet Lassi were awsome , great food , great servives with reasonable prices"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Shikha vats,1,Its not a good place for indian food minimum for vegetarian Indian food. We ordered Samosas and it was very bad and and had smell. We tried to cancel our order but they said it already under process. Sag Paneer was average and Dal was bad. Will not recommend vegetarian Indian food at this place. üëé ‚Ä¶
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,M√©sz√°ros T√≠mea,5,"The food was great and for the lunch menu the prices are incredibly good. The service was also amazing, the guy was very kind and nice, helped us every way he could. Would go back every week if we would live closer!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Dan Castle,5,consistent. ordered garlic cheese naan and mushroom masala. naan had generous cheese and tasty. previously ordered veggie korma n chili naan. chili naan was spicy korma and it was good too
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Geren Lockhart,1,"Unfortunately the ownership isn't in the service business. After checking in about an order that was :20 min late for 90 min wait...I was dismissed and told to deal with it myself, after they were unable to figure out how to check by address to see if an order was out. I wouldn't trust that they value your business enough to care. Wonder what's in the food prep then, if it's the same disregard it's probably not good."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Zach Frankel,5,"I have eaten a lot of Indian food.  In many cases, it tastes like hot spicy slop.  Anar has the most flavorful Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever had.  Amazing Saag Paneer.  This is the best Indian food I have ever had."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Crystal Brooke Alforque,5,One of my favorite restaurants!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,lizy ryan,5,"This has been our go-to for take out and we honestly get it once a week. Delicious food. Love the chicken tika masala, garlic naan, somosas and mango lassis."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Abhinav Srivastava,1,"As soon as I saw the chicken curry we had ordered, we realized it was a big big mistake.  I've ever come accross a more tasteless curry.  It brought back horrible memories of potato curry I used to have at my hostel."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Mukesh Vadhvani,1,"I was visiting LA, ordered chicken biryani and chicken madras,  ask them to make spicy. The only thing we can taste was red chilly powder,  spicy doesn't mean exta red chilly powder."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Phil Ives,1,I ordered a dinner and some naan. I opened up the bag and they forgot the Rice and my soup.When I called they refused to deliver the rice and offered me a $3 refund. $3 off a $25.00 meal that was mediocre at best and i had tipped the driver $4.00 .. Skip this place
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Karthik,2,"I ordered chicken Biryani and shrimp Biryani, Instead I got Chicken and shrimp mixed in Peas pulao.

Dear Chef, try to read some recipes and understand the difference between pulao and Biryani.

For Pulao, you add peas, vegetables like carrot, beans and colves with rice.

For Biryani, you add a lot of spices, ginger, garlic, chilli and no vegetables unless it is vegetable Biryani. When you open a Biryani, it should smell spices, not like the one you sent."
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Gourmet Soul Vegetarian,1,"Disgusting, threw it all away. Literally the nastiest Indian food I've ever had. Run skip this place by all means!!!!"
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Cassandra Falk,4,Anar has the best Indian food. This is one of favorite places to come and eat. Their food was all savory and full of flavor. The staffs are all friendly and very helpful. Definitely recommend all their dishes and be back.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Stephanie Mello,5,I love getting delivery from Anar.   I feel it's more healthy than many Indian food places and I can tell there isnt a bunch of dye on the tandorri to make it neon pink.   I don't know for sure but I don't wake up with that bad feeling the next day ;)
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,George Anton,5,Great Indian Food At Is Best. Delivery With In 5 Miles & Takeout. All Dishes Are Made To Order Delivered Hot And Fresh Right At Your Front Door.
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Ashlynne Kaur,1,Very unhygienic place food not good no any salads and dessert with dinner plate. Too expensive with nothing
1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Lori Howard,1,"Horrible service!!  We ordered and paid online.  Order was not ready when we arrived.  Charged us again when we arrived.  Came home and order was not our order!!  Called they acknowledged we got the wrong order, we drove back to get the correct order and they refused to  compensate us for anything.  POOR SERVICE!  Will never recommend or return!"

1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Michael Wiles,5,A nice little Indian restaurant. Everything is neat and has its charm. For eating there are a few large tables in the room and small dining areas. Almost romantic. The food was plentiful and cheap. The service was very quick. And my wish for maximum spiciness in the food was fully met (that's really rare). Really great. Can only be recommended. Free parking and free WiFi.

1,Anar Indian Restaurant,Jill Guido,5,Yummm
2,Gate Of India,Kevin Brian Bader,4,"I ordered through Uber and the food is pretty good 4/5, not the best but it's worth trying at least once.

Note that most of the 1‚≠êÔ∏è reviews are from weird indian names so they might be competition posting fake negative reviews."
2,Gate Of India,Arashpreet Singh,1,"The food was so unappetizing it looked like it had been sitting out for days, the service was nonexistent, and the atmosphere was so dingy and uncomfortable I felt like I was eating in a back alley; I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this place at all costs."
2,Gate Of India,Life of Sandhu,1,"Worst place and worst staff and worst stuff and stuff is also extra expensive then others , they don‚Äôt know how to treat a customer. I think they need some manners and common sense with some discipline and training."
2,Gate Of India,Tarandeep Singh,1,There is not good restaurant there is charge for the over price. There is not good food bad service and also does not give the tip on the employee. There is two bad restaurant.
2,Gate Of India,bhavya jain,1,We went there after a long time with our entire family the experience was highly disappointing. Saying the food and flavours were even average would be an exaggeration. The service could‚Äôve been more professional. Wish them best of luck if they embark on a journey of improvement.
2,Gate Of India,Tim O'Donnell,1,Ordered takeout & there was no salt on the Garlic naan bread or on the chicken tikka masala. I ordered the chicken tika masala with medium spice & there was absolutely no spice at all. The chicken was dry and chewy & the bread was also hard to chew. Expensive prices for low quality food.
2,Gate Of India,Simran Saggal,1,"Really bad experience they disappointed me
I ordered chicken Manchurian but they gave me chilli chicken . They really turns my excitement into disappoinment
Just waste of money and time.....‚òπÔ∏è"
2,Gate Of India,Ani Ny,1,"I would like to tell you that their food is wonderful but I never got it. I ordered my food at 2:50. I called at 5 pm because I still had not received it, they told me that the food suppose to arrive within 15 minutes. At 6 pm I still could not see any sing of my food so I canceled my order."
2,Gate Of India,Naman Modani,1,"Calling this Indian food is blasphemy. They serve maggi in the name of hakka noodles, and the food lacks flavor."
2,Gate Of India,sudhir pradhan,1,The food is really so bad no taste at all I ordered online and I am very disappointed with this the vegetable biryani taste like sweet rice and I ordered noodles they gave me Maggie seriously I have to spend money on this if I need Maggie I would make it my own seriously it‚Äôs so bad
2,Gate Of India,Wesley Rolph,1,"Ordered takeout 6pm, estimated delivery time was 7:10pm. I called at 7:40pm and they said it was out for delivery and should arrive soon. 8pm they cancel the order. When I call them they said there was traffic so they canceled the order. This makes no sense because supposedly they already cooked my food and spent what they said ""50min in traffic"". Not only did they lose the sale but they earned 1 star reviews on every platform for wasting 2hours of my time. So unprofessional of them, if they didn't want to deliver then they should have canceled shortly after receiving it not 2 hours later."
2,Gate Of India,rinnie,1,"believe the bad reviews, this food was horrible."
2,Gate Of India,Revant Adlakha,1,They served maggi in the name of vegetarian hakka noodles. Disgusting food. Shame in the name of indian cuisine. They should stop serving food.
