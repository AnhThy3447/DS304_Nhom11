339,horrible service by being hungry and tomato,,,,Negative,
339,they do not take their customers seriously at all,,,,Negative,
339,will never ever order from this place again nor will my friends order from here again,,,,,Negative
340,well sometimes rating can be misleading,,,,,
340,we visited they restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine,,,,,
340,they beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of corona bucket,,,,,
340,bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled,,,,Negative,
340,well here they good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp,,,,,

344,they chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as i thought and they tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp,,,,,
344,and if this was not enough they add on was they main course,,,,,
344,they name mentioned in they menu for they main course resembles more of a continental food which creates a lot of confusion,,,,,
344,we ordered three dishes for main course not having any about they fact that they dishes are gravies rather than semi gravy,,,,,
344,they worst is they suggestions from they manager who suggested us to have a rice item along with they dishes we ordered,,,,Negative,
344,knowing that they dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for three people to have that much gravy it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them,,,,,
344,moreover despite of showing they tomato gold coupon they code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about they food they added an extra service charge to they final bill,,,,Negative,
344,will not complain much about they ambience but they food menu is a bit confusing,,,,,
344,my suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking and importantly do not try and take suggestion from they management,,,,,
344,been to many asian restaurants had bad food but never got so confused about they menu,,,,,
344,i had san dip zachary a with me,,,,,
