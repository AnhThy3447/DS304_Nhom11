25,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,but today a visit gave a totally different vibe from they moment i walked in,146
25,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,no customers i they decor was basic no longer gives that cultural vibe,147
25,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,then there was menu discrepancies,148
26,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,there is ample parking in front it is just a little walk away from walk of fame,149
26,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they food is rather basic but good if you want a quick meal such as their chicken plate,150

31,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they curry beef was medium spicy they cuts were well cooked they curry was made so you can eat it with something sweet and less salt than what many are used to if your salty bring a shaker they rice was seven and they flat bread was eight,175
31,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,presentation they curry portion was a little big they plate was polished steel my fax,176
31,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they bread might be better cut into semi circular pieces,177
31,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they place needs a little remodel but i like they unkept furniture,178
32,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,seriously so good,179
32,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they naan are amazing and veggie marsala is delicious,180

34,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,this place is awesome,191
34,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,you get a lot of food for what you pay and they korma is one of they best indian dishes i be ever had,192
34,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,one word of warning last i checked they dinner combo with they soup costs more than all of its components individually,193
34,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,so it is best to buy individual dishes rice naan etc when you order here,194
35,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,we ordered chicken bryan and it is not like bryan at all and very bad taste,195
35,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,samosa and panzer nikki was horrible and we had stomach upset,196

36,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,i was even gifted to try their ginger mint lemonade and a soup because i expressed interest after he rang me up,202
36,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,if you want ambience this is not your place,203
36,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,but if you crave good indian food after work one day where you can be in and out maybe with a friend and be taken care of really well this is your spot,204
36,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,great for take away,205

37,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,i was thankful that when i moved from los felix to soho that i was still in their delivery area,207
37,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,we always get they veg dinner for two and it is always mountain of well prepared and tasty food for a pretty reasonable price,208
38,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,prices are outrageous a sage paper rice and garlic naan twenty one yeah right it is just a plain rip off they sage used to come with rice but now it is an extra four dollars for a small portion of rice this place will never see another dime from me,209
38,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,i a surprised it is not out of business yet they sage used to be eight ninety nine there,210
38,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,nobody is going to pay twenty one dollars for a small cup of sage and rice,211
39,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,this is clearly a family operated place devoted to good food and service they are open late hours for they hollywood neighbourhood who loved them and this adds to they friendly copy vibe,212
39,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,customers love their blended tea and lemonade drinks so they bottle them now,213

42,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they food is of but nothing indian we ordered veg bryan and it had zucchini in it in yellow rice,231
42,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,not authentic indian food,232
43,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,both stars for service provided warm water freshly made tea salad upon request,233
43,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,veg dishes tasted better day okra naan roth chicken dishes had a smell,234
43,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,photos is real ambiance is very different they rating must be because of they regular customers,235
44,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they had a suspicious number of five star reviews on grub hub so i should have known they hype is bogus everybody,236
44,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they veggie samosas were delicious,237
44,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they portions were nice,238

51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,hanna marsala was cooked in they same sauce which is used for butter chicken or butter panzer,276
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,which was not they way you cook hanna marsala,277
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,despite that it was pathetic tasteless and full of color instead of spices,278
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,on top of that they server was very rude,279
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,my friend wanted to make sure that tandoori roth they had in their menu was made of whole wheat,280
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,they servers behavior was weird instead of telling us straight that yes it is made of whole wheat he said what else would that be,281
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,one of they worst experience in a restaurant ever,282
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,i would say to people of los angeles and whoever visiting do not go to this restaurant,283
51,1,Anar Indian Restaurant,do not make they mistake i made by seeing four star on yelp,284
